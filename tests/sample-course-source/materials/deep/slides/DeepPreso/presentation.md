## Syntax highlighting

You can also add `code` to your slides:

<div class="impact">Some HTML code</div>
```

## CSS classes

You can use .alt[shortcut] syntax to apply .big[some style!]

...or just <span class="alt">HTML</span> if you prefer.

## 12-column grid layout

Use the included bootstrap-like **grid layout** classes to split content easily:
.col-4[
  ### Left column

  - I'm using the `.col-4` class
]
.col-8.space-left[
  ### Right column

  - I'm a very long text and I'm using the `.col-8` class
]

## .space-top[Learn the tricks]

See the [wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) to learn more of what you can do with .alt[Remark.js]

# Icons: Font Awesome
## Thousands of icons... some quick examples of what it looks like

Making a point about E-commerce? <i class="fas fa-shopping-cart fa-3x"></i> Use `fas`, the Font Awesome solid font-family with the shopping-cart icon in the size that makes sense.

```html
<i class="fas fa-shopping-cart fa-3x"></i>
```


<i class="fab fa-android fa-2x"></i> Maybe you need to reference mobile brands.<i class="fab fa-apple fa-2x"></i> Use `fab`, the Font Awesome brands font-family.

```html
<i class="fab fa-android fa-2x"></i>
```

We are pulling the free version 5 library so we are able to load the font-family classes `fas` (solid), `fab` (brands), and `far` (regular). 

Check the Font Awesome docs to see what else you can do and browse the Font Awesome gallery to find more: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free
